# CSCI4448_Project2
Project 2 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design / CU-Boulder / SP'20

Team Members: Max Marfuggi (Solo)

For this project, I used C++ in the CLion IDE from JetBrains. To run the code, simply download the entire repository and run it with all the files in the same directory. If any files are moved from their current layout, the program will not run. There are no alterations that need to be made for the code to run. All of the files are .h and .cpp files, so they should transfer to other IDEs seemlessly if the CMakeFiles mess up any system configurations.

The file titled 'Project2.out' contains the output when the program is executed.
